# Goal

Use the available actions to transform the initial state into the goal state.

# Output Format

Return a sequence of actions, one per line, in the order they should be applied.

# Warnings

An action can only be applied if all its preconditions are true in the current state.
When an action is applied, its effects update the current state by adding and removing facts.
The goal is reached when all facts in the goal state are present in the current state.
A valid plan must transform the initial state into the goal state using only applicable actions.
Starting from the initial state, choose an applicable action, apply it, and repeat this process until the goal is reached.
If no sequence of actions can reach the goal, return nothing.
